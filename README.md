# Final Assignment
Repository for the Assigment of Coding for Economists CEU Fall 2020

Observation:
I created the assignment with a database of football in mind but that didn`t work out. 
So only during the folder structure txt you can sometimes find something like "football-assignment".

#1 If you want to understand how the folder structure was created through the GitBash just open the txt file: "Folder_structure"

#2 The python tasks are divided in two codes: The first "Loops and Lists" where I used a database from the weather in December from NYC.
The second code "Python Functions" is the one regarding the def functions created. Both are in the folder "Code"

#3 The Stata tasks are based in a Life Expectancy and GDP per capita data from the World Bank, the data is in the folder: "Data".
The coding regarding the tasks are in the folder: "Code" listed as Do files. The Master file has erverything, you can just run it to see.
The paths used in the code is through the VirtualLab and then to my pc.
The "Output" folder is where the regression table and the graph generated from the manipulation and analysis of the data is located.

Thank you for everything during the course.
Bernardo Bandeira.
